## ❓Why

There a few reasons for me making this:

* Personally, I find that teaching something **well** means truly knowing it. So teaching technologies in these courses has forced me to really understand them.
* Create a standard format for learning courses so its easy to reference them in the future
* 100% open source courses compared to other projects on GitHub that are merely collections of good classes.
