# 01 Hello World

Welcome to the dart programming language! Lets get started. Below is a simple dart program that prints `Hello World!` to the screen.

```dart
void main() {
    print('Hello world!');
}
```

_[helloWorld.dart](code/helloWorld.dart)_

Whats important to us in this script is `print('Hello World!');`, which is what actually prints `Hello World` to the screen. `void` and `main` will be explained more in other lessons. All you need to know for now is that `print();` prints something to the console.
