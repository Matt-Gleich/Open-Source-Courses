# Comments

Comments in any language are used to explain the code you are writing. You can put anything you want in a comment. There are two types of comments in dart:

## Single Line Comments

Used for quick explanations

```dart
void main() {
    // Here is a single line comment

    // First line
    // Second line
    // Third line
}
```

_[comments.dart](code/comments.dart)_

Anything that comes after `//` on a line will a comment

## Multi-line Comments

Used for longer explanations

```dart
void main() {
    /*
    So
    many
    lines!
    */
}
```

_[comments.dart](code/comments.dart)_

Anything in between `/*` and `*/`, no matter the line, will be a comment.
